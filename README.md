A web-based application that reads RSS feeds. Followed Test-driven Development. Used Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These tests, test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation. Done as a part of Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree.
